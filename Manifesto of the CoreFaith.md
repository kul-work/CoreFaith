# Manifesto of the New Faith

## Core Values

**Love and Compassion**: We believe in the power of love above all else. Love your neighbor as yourself, showing kindness, empathy, and understanding in all interactions. Whether it's a small act of helping a stranger carry groceries or offering emotional support to a friend in need, compassion should guide every action.

**Forgiveness**: Let go of grudges and anger. Forgive those who have wronged you, for holding onto resentment only poisons the soul. True freedom comes from the act of forgiving, allowing relationships to be healed and hearts to be lightened.

**Non - Harm**: Do not cause harm to others, physically, emotionally, or mentally. This principle forms the bedrock of our community. We respect the dignity and well - being of every individual, and any form of violence or cruelty is strictly prohibited.

**Property Respect**: Recognize and respect the property rights of others. Just as we value our own possessions, we should treat the property of others with the same care and consideration. Theft or destruction of another's property is a violation of this fundamental principle.

**Personal Responsibility**: Each person is responsible for their own actions and choices. We encourage self - improvement, self - reflection, and the pursuit of personal growth. By taking ownership of our lives, we can better contribute to the well - being of the community.

## Community and Interaction

**Voluntary Association**: Our community is based on voluntary participation. People come together because they share these values, not because they are forced to. We encourage open - mindedness and the free exchange of ideas within the community.

**Mutual Support**: Members of the community should support one another in times of need. This could be through financial assistance, providing a listening ear, or offering practical help. We believe that a strong community is built on the foundation of mutual care.

## The Path Forward

**Living the Values**: Each day, strive to live out these principles in your daily life. Whether at home, at work, or in social settings, let these values be your guide.

**Spreading the Message**: Share these values with others. By example and by word, inspire those around you to embrace love, compassion, non - harm, and personal responsibility.
